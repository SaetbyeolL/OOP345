By binding function to arguments in this workshop, Binding a function with placeholders allows you 
to adjust the position and quantity of values that the function will utilise, 
as well as modify the function based on the desired output. 
auto f = bind(digForTreasure, placeholders::_1, mark);

The advantages of multiple threads are 
(1) It enhances performance by decreased development time.
(2) It Simplify and streamline program coding.
(3) It better use of CPU resource.
(4) It parallelize occurrence of tasks simultaneous.
In this workshop, I used 4threads to encode single file. 
This can make process the encoding simultaneously in multi-core CPU.
